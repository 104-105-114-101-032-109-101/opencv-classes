# OpenCV Classes

I am teaching a portuguese student to use [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) in a small project, while learning it myself.

This is a personal and well-commented set of scripts that might be useful for people with some computer vision knowledge getting into OpenCV.

| File        | Content           | is Complete  |
| ----------- |-------------| -----|
| `calibration/simple-calibration.py`    | Image calibration functions and a side-by-side view of the original and calibrated images | :heavy_check_mark: |
| `calibration/complete-calibration.py`  | Same as above but with a cube rendered on top of the calibrated image | :heavy_check_mark: |
| `coeff.yml`| File with calibration values for my camera, generated by the scripts above | :heavy_check_mark: |
| `detection/detect-images-simple.py`| Recognizes an image from a calibrated camera capture | :heavy_check_mark: |
